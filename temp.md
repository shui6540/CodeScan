❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum(){return a+b;}
```

🔍 Issues:
* ❌ The variables `a` and `b` are not defined within the function's scope, nor are they passed as arguments. This will
likely lead to errors or unexpected behavior.

✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:
* ✔ Accepts two arguments, `a` and `b`, making the function reusable and predictable.
* ✔ The function now explicitly defines its inputs, enhancing readability and reducing potential errors.
